                I am a 19 year old currently working in the tech industry as a junior software developer.
                I have been programming since I was 13 and immediately loved the problem-solving aspect of it.
                I wanted to use my programming skills in my career, so I decided, for A-Levels, to move to <a className="font-bold text-accent-400 hover:text-accent-500 underline" href="https://www.rondearingutc.com">Ron Dearing UTC</a> to expand on my knowledge and to set me up for the world of work.
                I left Ron Dearing to join <a className="font-bold text-accent-400 hover:text-accent-500 underline" href="https://sauce.dev"> Sauce Consultants Ltd.</a> who specialise in working with large corporates as their digital partner, who make software, despoke to the company themselves.

                I am also very passionate in music. Firstly I play a variety of instruments, piano, guitar, drums; and have been playing for up to 10 years for some. I also collect vinyl records and love to play them. Iâ€™ve been steadily building my collection over the years to what I think is a good display piece I have for my home. My most treasured album that I have got is The Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd, and the most recent one I have picked up is Back to the Water Below by Royal Blood
